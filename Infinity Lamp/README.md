## Infinity Mirror: Technical documentation

Link to blog (creative documentation): https://andreabus99.github.io/2023/05/05/infinity-mirror.html

On this project, I created an infinity mirror using an LED strip.

What do you need for this project:
<li> TTGO T-Display ESP32 </li>
<li> USB-C cable </li>
<li> Breadboard </li>
<li> Swtich </li>
<li> 16ft WS2812b LEDs strip </li>
<li> Wires</li>


<h3> Steps </h3>

1. <h4>Laser-cut acrylic sheets:</h4> In case it is useful, I added the illustrator file I used for laser cutting. You can download this file. First, you need to laser cut a square that is 12 inches by 12 inches into a clear acrylic sheet. Then you need to laser cut the sides of the lamp (also acrylic), I decide to make them a width of 2 inches, but this is up to you. <br> <img width="250" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-05 at 5 34 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80929001/236572710-857b431d-ac55-49d3-aabf-9044ef831642.png">
2. <h4>Glue the sides together:</h4> Once you have all the parts ready, you should start by sticking the LED strip into one of the sides. I decide to do it in the center of each piece. Be careful, as the adhesive is very strong and once it touches a surface it is hard to take it out. Then, glue another side piece, and keep doing this until you have completed the square and every side has the continuous LED strip. Cut the LED strip where needed (be sure that you cut where you are supposed to, the copper)<br> <img width="250" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-05 at 5 36 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80929001/236572814-3f69f7f7-0a5d-45f9-a606-a36bc2ae85ca.png">

3. <h4>Add the one-way mirror film to the clear acrylic sheet:</h4> Spray water and soap into one side of your acrylic sheet and then add the mirror film. Take away any bubbles (a credit card can be useful). Let it dry for a few minutes. Here is a video if needed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKIsQ3J4VCg.
4. <h4>Add the mirrors:</h4> Add the normal mirror to one side of the enclosure (make sure the solid side is facing outwards). Then add the other acrylic sheet that you just added the mirror film to the other side (make sure that the more reflective side is facing inwards, this is the side that has the film applied to it)
5. <h4>Connect wires:</h4> Connect all the wires to the breadboard accordingly (check the Arduino program if you have to change the pins). Don't forget to plug in the switch too!
6. <h4>Flash code and turn it on:</h4> Connect your lamp to power, and then turn it on using the switch. The lights will turn on and create different patterns. <br> <img width="250" alt="Screen Shot 2023-05-05 at 5 37 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80929001/236572994-b15f685e-efcf-4bfd-8052-3832e9e3c802.png">
